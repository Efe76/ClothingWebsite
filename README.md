# Clothingwebsite

GreenWear is a fully online and modern clothing store concept, in which u can buy clothes and design your own clothes using a text to image API. This website was inspired by our study itself (AriticialIntelligence). It was made during my UVA WebTechKI24 course project.
Tech used: HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP/MySQL
Online soures used: PHPmailer

Here are some of my responsibilities during this project:

    Created the FAQ, About Us, Sign Up, Log In, Admin, Profile, Contact and Shoppingcart pages. (HTML/CSS) (The pages are mobilefriendly and W3C compliant)
    Set up the the logout and delete account scripts (PHP)
    Created the admin system to see a overview of the products in catalog, delete and add products in the Admin Page (mySQL,PHP)
    Created both the login and sign up system, including validation. added form user-friendliness, retain correct signup inputs in the case of a signup error. (mySQL,PHP,JS)
    Created the rememberme function using PHPcookies (mySQL,PHP)
    Did the PHP part of the design page with the text2img API in it. Saving the img, category, and user who created it in mySQL and adding it to the catalog. (PHP)
    Created the ShoppingCart system, adding to cart, removing from cart and checking out (PHP)
    Changed the default session_start() of PHP so that it regenerates sessionID every hour. file name: securesession.inc.php. (PHP)
    Lead the team: organized meetings, structure of products and files, merged all files etc.

note: This was my first website, with nearly no experience. So the code might violate the DRY principle entirely
